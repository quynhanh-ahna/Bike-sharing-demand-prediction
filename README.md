# FDC104 Bike sharing demand prediction

Currently rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.
The dataset contains _weather information_ (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the _number of bikes rented_ per hour and _date_ information.

### Attribute Information
Date : year-month-day
<br> Rented Bike count - Count of bikes rented at each hour (output attribute)
<br> Hour - Hour of he day
<br> Temperature-Temperature in Celsius
<br> Humidity - %
<br> Windspeed - m/s
<br> Visibility - 10m
<br> Dew point temperature - Celsius
<br> Solar radiation - MJ/m2
<br> Rainfall - mm
<br> Snowfall - cm
<br> Seasons - Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn
<br> Holiday - Holiday/No holiday
<br> Functional Day - NoFunc(Non Functional Hours), Fun(Functional hours)

### Task
Explore the dataset and create a simple model to predict the "rented bike count"
